# Minor project
## Spotify Recommendation System
### Introduction
In today's digital age, music streaming services have revolutionized how we discover and enjoy music, with Spotify leading the way through its sophisticated recommendation system. By analyzing users' listening habits, Spotify's algorithm identifies patterns and similarities among songs and artists, enabling the creation of personalized playlists that align with individual tastes. The success of this system is rooted in its ability to cluster songs based on their auditory features, thereby understanding the properties that define different tracks.

This project aims to develop an automated music recommendation system inspired by Spotify's methodology, utilizing a dataset of user listening habits and song characteristics. By extracting key auditory features such as tempo, rhythm, and melody, and applying clustering algorithms, the project will group songs with similar attributes. This will allow the recommendation algorithm to suggest new tracks that resonate with users' existing preferences. Through continuous evaluation and refinement, the goal is to create a robust system that enhances the music discovery experience, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in the realm of personalized entertainment

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop an automated music recommendation system that leverages advanced machine learning techniques to provide personalized music suggestions, inspired by Spotify's successful algorithm. By utilizing a comprehensive dataset containing various attributes of Spotify tracks, including track details, album information, playlist context, and extensive audio features, the project aims to identify user preferences, cluster similar tracks, and enhance music discovery. Through the extraction and analysis of these features, the project will create a recommendation algorithm that suggests new tracks resonating with users' existing tastes. Continuous evaluation and refinement will ensure the system's accuracy and user satisfaction, ultimately demonstrating the potential of machine learning and data analysis in transforming music discovery and interaction.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a comprehensive collection of Spotify tracks, carefully curated to support the development of an automated music recommendation system. It includes essential attributes such as track ID, name, artist, and popularity, providing key details about each song. Additionally, it offers extensive album information, including album ID, name, and release date, which aids in contextual analysis. The dataset also incorporates playlist-related data, such as playlist name, ID, genre, and subgenre, reflecting user-curated collections and preferences. Crucial audio features like danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, and duration are included as well, enabling a thorough analysis of the auditory properties of each track. These features collectively support the development of a sophisticated recommendation algorithm by allowing for the clustering of songs based on their similarities, ultimately enhancing the music discovery experience for users
