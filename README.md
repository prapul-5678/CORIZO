## About Corizo
Corizo is an internship company that offers a variety of courses and hands-on projects to help individuals gain practical experience in their chosen fields. Through Corizo, I have completed an Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning course. As part of this course, I worked on two significant projects: a minor project focused on a Spotify song recommendation system and a major project aimed at predicting cardiovascular disease.

## Minor Project: Spotify Song Recommendation System

### Description
The Spotify Song Recommendation System is designed to provide personalized song suggestions to users based on their listening history and preferences. This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze user data and recommend songs that are likely to be enjoyed by the user. By using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods, the system identifies patterns in user behavior and song attributes to deliver accurate and enjoyable recommendations.

### Installation and Usage
To run this project locally, users need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies. After setting up the environment, they can execute the main script to start the recommendation system. Detailed instructions on installation and usage are provided in the repository.

### Dataset
The dataset utilized in this project encompasses various attributes of songs, including features like tempo, key, and loudness, as well as user listening history. This rich dataset allows the system to make informed recommendations based on both the characteristics of the songs and the preferences of the users.

### Model and Results
The recommendation system employs collaborative filtering and content-based filtering models to suggest songs. The results section includes visualizations, accuracy scores, and other relevant metrics to demonstrate the effectiveness of the recommendation system. These results highlight the system's capability to provide personalized and accurate song recommendations.

## Major Project: Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

### Description
The Cardiovascular Disease Prediction System aims to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease in patients using machine learning models. This project involves comprehensive data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation to ensure accurate predictions. The goal is to provide a reliable tool that can assist healthcare professionals in early detection and prevention of cardiovascular diseases.

### Installation and Usage
To run this project locally, users need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies. After setting up the environment, they can execute the main script to start the prediction system. Detailed instructions on installation and usage are provided in the repository.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes patient data with various health attributes such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant medical information. This dataset enables the model to learn from a wide range of factors that contribute to cardiovascular diseases, enhancing its predictive accuracy.

### Model and Results
The prediction system utilizes various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to predict cardiovascular disease. Each model is trained and evaluated to determine its accuracy and effectiveness. The results section includes visualizations, accuracy scores, and other relevant metrics to demonstrate the performance of the prediction models. These results illustrate the system's ability to accurately identify individuals at risk of cardiovascular diseases.
